CVR-Colorizer
=============

Paint tool and editor for the CVR files found in Sid's Alpha Centauri

Middle mouse click zooms in and out on the views.
Left click paints left color, right click paints right color and you select colors by left or right clicking on the palette.

Limitations:
The program doesn't know what all the colors are for the object.  So the color codes at the end of the list are unknown.  You can paint with them, but the program doesn't know what color to display on screen.
